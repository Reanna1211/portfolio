**Electric and Plug-In Hybrid Cars in Washington (Tableau Dashboard)**

As the adoption of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles continues to rise, understanding regional trends can provide valuable insights into consumer preferences and infrastructure planning. This dashboard focuses on Washington state, where the growth of electric vehicles is particularly notable.

**Dataset Information:**

The dataset for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and contains information on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) currently registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).

* Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV): An all-electric vehicle using one or more batteries to store the electrical energy that powers the motor, charged by plugging the vehicle into an electric power source.
* Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV): A vehicle that uses one or more batteries to power an electric motor and another fuel source (e.g., gasoline or diesel) for an internal combustion engine. It is charged by plugging into an electric power source.

The dataset shows monthly vehicle counts by county, and note that county assignments may change due to improvements in the registration process.

**Key Features:**

* Car Make Parameter: Select a car make to dynamically update visualisations. The selected make is highlighted in a unique colour across all graphs.
* Donut Chart: Displays the total number of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles for the selected make.
* Bar Graphs:
 * A horizontal bar graph shows the number of cars for each make, with the option to expand and show details for models.
 * A graph of the top 10 counties in Washington with the most electric and hybrid vehicles.
* Map: Visualises the geographical distribution of the selected car make via postcodes in Washington.
* Stacked Bar Chart: Displays the number of electric and hybrid cars for each year (2008â€“2023) by car make.

**Data Insights:**

* Tesla is the most popular electric vehicle make, while Bentley has the least number of EVs.
* King County in Washington has the highest number of electric vehicles.
* The Northwest region of Washington shows the highest density of electric and hybrid vehicles, as seen in the map.
* The dataset shows that electric vehicles (EVs) outnumber plug-in hybrids, with a total of 99,959 EVs and 30,179 hybrid vehicles in Washington state.

**Technical Skills:**

This Tableau project demonstrates my proficiency in using various advanced features to create an interactive and informative dashboard:

* Interactive Filters: I implemented filters allowing users to explore data based on the selected car make.
* Calculated Fields: Used to create parameter filters to enhance visualisation and interactivty with the data and ensure post codes where in United States.
* Sets: I used sets to group counties to find the top 10 counties.
* Dynamic Parameters: Utilised dynamic parameters to make the dashboard more interactive, updating visualisations based on user input.

**How to Use:**
To explore the data, use the 'Car Make' filter to select a specific vehicle make. The dashboard will update with visualisations showing the number of vehicles for the selected make, distribution by county, and more.

**Conclusion:**
This dashboard provides valuable insights into the state of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in Washington, highlighting the popularity of certain makes, the distribution of vehicles by county, and changes over time. It showcases my ability to work with complex datasets and present them in an accessible, interactive format.
