Welcome to my Data Science and Analytics portfolio. This collection of projects showcases my skills, knowledge, and passion for working with data. I am currently studying online courses to transition into a career as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst. Through these projects, I aim to build my expertise, confidence, and technical abilities, preparing myself to contribute to real-world business problems.

**About Me:**
I am dedicated to learning and growing in the field of data science. My portfolio reflects my journey as I acquire the necessary skills for a career in this field. I enjoy working with data, finding patterns, and uncovering insights that can drive decision-making. Each project in this portfolio demonstrates a different aspect of data science, from data cleaning and analysis to visualisation and model-building.

**Portfolio Projects:**

* **Roller Coaster Analysis** (Python)
  Overview: In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of roller coasters using publicly available data. The analysis includes various functions and visualisations to explore key attributes of roller coasters such as speed, height, length, seating types, number of inversions, and operational status. This project showcases my Python skills and demonstrates my ability to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and produce meaningful visualisations.

  Key Features:

  * Data Analysis Functions: Created flexible functions to analyse different roller coasters, their attributes, and trends over time.
  * Visualisations: Various types of visualisations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts, to help understand roller coaster attributes.
  * Interactivity: Functions that allow users to specify different parameters (e.g., roller coasters, variables such as speed or height) for analysis.

* **Codeflix Churn Rate Analysis** (SQL)

  Overview: This project involved calculating and visualising churn rates across customer segments for a subscription-based service. I explored churn rates for different segments over time, cleaned the data to handle issues such as missing or invalid values, and generated actionable insights to improve customer retention. This project allowed me to practice SQL and data analysis skills, especially in data cleaning and resolving issues.

  Objective:

  * Calculate churn rates for different customer segments over time (January to March 2017).
  * Identify and address data quality issues, such as invalid or missing data points.
  * Visualise the results to provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

  Key Features:
  * Data Cleaning: Handled missing or invalid data points to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
  * Churn Rate Calculation: Calculated churn rates across customer segments.
  * Visualisation: Generated charts to communicate trends and insights to stakeholders.
  * Code Flexibility: Included code that can be adapted to analyse churn rates for multiple segments, not just two.

* **Electric and Plug-In Hybrid Cars in Washington** (Tableau)

  Overview: This Tableau project analyses the distribution of electric and plug-in hybrid cars in Washington state. I created an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore various aspects of the data, including the number of vehicles by make, county, and year. This project showcases my ability to work with Tableau to create interactive and insightful data visualisations.

  Key Features:
  * Car Make Parameter: Select a car make to dynamically update visualisations.
  * Donut Chart: Displays the total number of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles for the selected make.
  * Bar Graphs and Map: Visualises the number of vehicles by make, county, and region.
  * Stacked Bar Chart: Displays the number of electric and hybrid cars for each year (2008â€“2023) by car make.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
* Data Analysis: Handling, cleaning, and analysing data using Python and SQL to derive insights.
* Data Visualisation: Creating insightful visualisations using tools like Tableau and Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* SQL: Writing complex queries, including aggregations, joins, and window functions to extract and analyse data.
* Python: Building functions for data analysis, handling large datasets, and performing exploratory data analysis.
* Tableau: Designing interactive dashboards, using filters and parameters to allow users to explore data dynamically.
* Problem Solving: Identifying and addressing data quality issues, interpreting results, and providing actionable business insights.

**Conclusion:**

This portfolio represents my growing expertise in data science and analytics. Through these projects, I have demonstrated my ability to use industry-standard tools and techniques to solve real-world problems. I am excited to continue building on these skills and transitioning into a full-time role as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst. If you are interested in learning more about any of the projects or have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
