Project Overview

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of roller coasters using publicly available data. The analysis includes various functions and visualisations to explore key attributes of roller coasters such as speed, height, length, seating types, number of inversions, and operational status. The project demonstrates my ability to work with data science tools and techniques, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualisation.

**Key Features**
* Data Analysis Functions: Created flexible functions to analyse different roller coasters, their attributes, and trends over time.
* Visualisations: Various types of visualisations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts, to help understand roller coaster attributes.
* Interactivity: Functions that allow users to specify different parameters (e.g., roller coasters, variables such as speed or height) for analysis.

**Analyses Performed**

1. Ranking Over Time:
* Plotted the rankings of specific roller coasters over time to examine how their popularity has changed.
* Example: "El Toro" at Six Flags Great Adventure.

2. Comparison of Roller Coaster Rankings:
* Compared the rankings of multiple roller coasters (e.g., "El Toro" vs. "Boulder Dash") over time to evaluate relative performance.

3. Top n Rankings:
* Visualised the top N roller coasters based on their rankings over time, allowing for insights into the most consistently ranked coasters.

4. Height, Speed, and Inversions Distributions:
* Analysed and visualised the distributions of attributes like speed, height, and the number of inversions across roller coasters.
* Included histograms for each attribute to show the spread and trends in the data.

5. Seating Types and Average Characteristics:
* Explored the different seating types of roller coasters and calculated the average height, speed, and length for each seating type.
* Visualised the frequency of seating types and the relationship between seating type and other attributes.

6. Operational Status:
* Used pie charts to visualise the proportion of roller coasters that are currently operating versus those that are permanently closed.

7. Scatter Plots:
* Created scatter plots to examine relationships between different attributes such as height and speed, while removing outliers for a cleaner visualisation.

**Tools and Technologies**
* Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation.
* Pandas: For data processing and analysis.
* Matplotlib: For creating visualisations such as bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots.
* Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive analysis and presenting the results.

**Data Sources**
The analysis uses a publicly available dataset containing information about roller coasters, including their name, material type, seating type, speed, height, number of inversions, status, and park location.

**How to Use**
To run this analysis locally, clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebooks. You can easily modify the functions to analyse different roller coasters, parks, or attributes (e.g., speed, height, number of inversions, etc.).

**Steps:**
1. Clone the repository in terminal:

bash:
git clone https://github.com/Reanna1211/portfolio.git

cd portfolio/RollerCoasterAnalysis

2. Install the required libraries:

bash:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks and start running the analysis:

bash:
jupyter notebook

**Conclusion**
This project showcases my ability to handle real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis, and create insightful visualisations. By exploring different roller coasters and their attributes, I demonstrate my proficiency in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualisation techniquesâ€”skills essential for a data science career.
