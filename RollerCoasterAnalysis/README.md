Project Overview

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of roller coasters using publicly available data. The analysis includes various functions and visualisations to explore key attributes of roller coasters such as speed, height, length, seating types, number of inversions, and operational status. The project demonstrates my ability to work with data science tools and techniques, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualisation.

**Key Features**
* Data Analysis Functions: Created flexible functions to analyse different roller coasters, their attributes, and trends over time.
* Visualisations: Various types of visualisations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts, to help understand roller coaster attributes.
* Interactivity: Functions that allow users to specify different parameters (e.g., roller coasters, variables such as speed or height) for analysis.

**Project Goals**
1. Explore Key Roller Coaster Attributes:
* Analyse and visualise key attributes of roller coasters, such as speed, height, length, seating types, number of inversions, and operational status, to uncover patterns and trends.

2. Understand the Relationship Between Features:
* Investigate how different attributes, like speed and height, correlate with one another. Create visual representations (e.g., scatter plots) to explore these relationships in-depth.

3. Track Roller Coaster Rankings Over Time:
* Use historical ranking data to track the performance of individual roller coasters over the years and compare different coasters to identify trends in popularity.

4. Provide Insights on Seating Types and Ride Characteristics:
* Analyse how different seating types (e.g., sit-down, suspended) affect the average height, speed, and length of coasters, providing insights into design preferences and ride experiences.

5. Examine Operational Status of Coasters:
* Investigate the proportion of roller coasters that are still operating versus those that have been permanently closed. Understand how this impacts the overall roller coaster landscape.

6. Enhance Data Visualisation Skills:
* Use various visualisation techniques (histograms, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots) to effectively present the data and insights in a clear and engaging manner.

7. Create a Flexible Analysis Framework:
* Develop functions that allow for easy analysis of different roller coasters and attributes, enabling users to tailor the analysis to their specific interests (e.g., comparing coasters by speed or examining trends in seating types).

8. Showcase Data Science Skills:
* Demonstrate proficiency in data processing, analysis, and visualisation using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, while ensuring that the analysis is easily understandable for a non-technical audience.


**Analyses Performed**

1. Ranking Over Time:
* Plotted the rankings of specific roller coasters over time to examine how their popularity has changed.
* Example: "El Toro" at Six Flags Great Adventure.

2. Comparison of Roller Coaster Rankings:
* Compared the rankings of multiple roller coasters (e.g., "El Toro" vs. "Boulder Dash") over time to evaluate relative performance.

3. Top n Rankings:
* Visualised the top N roller coasters based on their rankings over time, allowing for insights into the most consistently ranked coasters.

4. Height, Speed, and Inversions Distributions:
* Analysed and visualised the distributions of attributes like speed, height, and the number of inversions across roller coasters.
* Included histograms for each attribute to show the spread and trends in the data.

5. Seating Types and Average Characteristics:
* Explored the different seating types of roller coasters and calculated the average height, speed, and length for each seating type.
* Visualised the frequency of seating types and the relationship between seating type and other attributes.

6. Operational Status:
* Used pie charts to visualise the proportion of roller coasters that are currently operating versus those that are permanently closed.

7. Scatter Plots:
* Created scatter plots to examine relationships between different attributes such as height and speed, while removing outliers for a cleaner visualisation.

**Tools and Technologies**
* Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation.
* Pandas: For data processing and analysis.
* Matplotlib: For creating visualisations such as bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots.
* Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive analysis and presenting the results.

**Data Sources**
The analysis uses a publicly available dataset containing information about roller coasters, including their name, material type, seating type, speed, height, number of inversions, status, and park location.

**How to Use**
To run this analysis locally, clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebooks. You can easily modify the functions to analyse different roller coasters, parks, or attributes (e.g., speed, height, number of inversions, etc.).

**Steps:**
1. Clone the repository in terminal:

bash:

git clone https://github.com/Reanna1211/portfolio.git

cd portfolio/RollerCoasterAnalysis

2. Install the required libraries:

bash:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks and start running the analysis:

bash:

jupyter notebook

**Conclusion**

This Roller Coaster Analysis project demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied to explore and visualise key attributes of roller coasters, such as speed, height, length, seating types, and operational status. By employing various functions and visualisations, we were able to analyse trends, compare performance across roller coasters, and gain insights into how different features correlate with each other.

Key Insights:
* Trends in Rankings: By tracking roller coaster rankings over time, we observed how some coasters maintain consistently high rankings, while others experience fluctuations. This highlights the impact of factors like ride experience and park management on a coaster's long-term success.
* Seat Type Analysis: Our analysis of seating types revealed the relationship between seating configurations and other attributes like height, speed, and length, providing insights into design choices and their impact on ride experiences.
* Operational Status: The pie chart analysis of operating versus closed coasters offered a clear view of the state of roller coasters in the dataset, reflecting the overall health and longevity of popular rides.

Implications and Next Steps:
* Future Analysis: Further analysis could explore additional features such as rider preferences, weather conditions, and visitor reviews, which could enhance the understanding of coaster popularity.
* Improving Ride Experiences: The insights from seating types and rankings can inform decisions on designing new roller coasters that cater to specific audience preferences, combining speed, height, and inversions in the right proportions.


Overall, this project not only highlights my ability to analyse and visualise data but also demonstrates how such analyses can inform business decisions and improve customer experiences in the amusement park industry.
